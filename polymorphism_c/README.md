# What is in this directory
`basic.c`
: A simple complete example of the basic setup.  Just one class.  No variables.

`overrode.c`
: A more complex complete example that adds a second class.

`vars.c`
: An exercise based on `basic.c` with the addition of a static variable.  In the exercise you will add instance variables, which requires figuring out how to handle `this`.

`complete.c`
: A complete example that incorporates the work done in `vars.c` with the multi-class stuff in `override.c`.  Also, a quick exercise where you will add a second procedure, `pong` to the parent class `A` while the sub-class `B` inherits this procedure.

`complete_pong.c`:
: The complete working example with `pong` added.
